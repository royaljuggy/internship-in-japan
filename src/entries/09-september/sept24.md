# BACK TO BACK BABY
Yes that's right. Back to back updates WHATTT??? For each vent, a blessing (I'm not sure what the opposite of a vent is) must be given back!

## Rrrrrrrrent
Alright it was fine. Actually it was amazing. A super sweet lady helped me through both my transactions at the ATM. Honestly she went above her pay-grade, going as far as to confirm that everything in my transaction was correct before I went through with it. I want to add that the ATM had an English version but it really wasn't that descriptive, which is why I asked for some help. Honestly, it went super smooth so I'm very glad with it.

## Dermatologist Experience
I've had a lot of sun spots appear on my skin which worried me a bit. Since I have insurance from my company, I thought why not get it checked out. Holy, there are so many clinics over here. No wonder their health care is so good. Obviously Japanese education is a level above even in Western standards, but the sheer abundance is really reassuring. I was able to register as a new patient, and complete my check-up in less than an hour. Maybe 30-40 minutes if I really counted. The receptionist, doctor, and nurse were all very caring in knowing that my Japanese health-term knowledge is very limited. The doctor herself also translated a statement with a lot of health terms using Google translate which was very nice. Super happy with my experience and I wish them all the best.

How does it compare to Canada? I guess with my family doctor, about the same, minus the registering part obviously. Getting a new family doctor is very hard in Canada right now and I honestly believe it's due to a lack of doctors, and an uptake in the number of people looking for doctors. What will always be the hardest thing about being a Canadian is knowing that for professionals, America is just much better pay-wise. I mean, yeah you lose your universal health care sucks, but if you're making let's say 300k USD a year and are receiving benefits on top of that, paying for your own health care really isn't much. Obviously it's a different story if you're living paycheck to paycheck or are earning around the median. That's the biggest thing Canada should change: aiming to retain our top professionals. Engineers, IT members, healthcare providers. And as such, we should as citizens respect those professionals.

That last sentence really is just me ranting about how many of the people I know want to move elsewhere, and speak of it as this magical experience that is smooth, easy, and simple! I mean let me give you a great anecdote: I was at Golden Gai in Shinjuku, drinking with some Americans. Rich ones, they live in San Francisco and one of them was an HR professional for a tech company. They told me that their goal was to move to Canada; interesting isn't it? Canadians want to move to America and Americans want to move to Canada. The grass is different on the other side, greener or not.

Anyways I don't want to become to political and the such but I think dumping out your thoughts once in a while is a decent idea.

Til' the next one!
