# Finished.
Wow. 4 months and 1 week later, and I'm already done my 8 month internship in Japan.

Okay if this is your first read of my blog that may sound weird- but it all comes down to the fact that my internship start got delayed until early August due to visa issues.

## Thoughts
Honestly, I don't feel extremely sad or extremely happy. If I had to choose, I'd say I'm happy; excited for what's in store. Throughout my life I've always been sad or afraid of 'the end,' whether that be the last day of highschool, the upcoming last day of my undergrad, or whatever other philosophical forthcoming. But I think this internship, and knowing that it's my last internship ever alongside my upcoming graduation, really made me mature and think: enjoy the moment, and don't worry about the future.

While of course having some sort of plan or thoughts about how to survive into the future is great, worrying about tiny things like what life will be like after graduation, how I'm going to be working for the next 50 or so years, or whatever else really just kills the mood of my present situation. I'm living in Japan, something that people would die for; I shouldn't spend my days worrying- they should be relaxed, and about searching for new experiences and appreciating the little things.

So yeah, on my last day of work I didn't feel particularly sad. I was excited for: the casual dinner with my coworkers, the nomikai and karaoke afterwards (haha) and of course that my friends were coming to Japan on December 26th (in 4 days!). Why would I kill my mood, and ruin the excitement I have for these future endeavours?

## What's happened since last time?
My cousin, her mom, and her friend all came to Tokyo, and I've been hanging out with them at every opportunity I could get. It's been really fun, mostly. I say mostly only because being a little translator isn't particularly up my alley. I do speak the language, and I can speak enough to survive, but I really don't enjoy speaking in a foreign language more than I need to; I'm not _that_ outgoing!

Anyways, I think the first day we met was a week ago yesterday and we walked around Harajuku. Not my kind of place, since it's too touristy, but no problem. Afterwards, we walked from Harajuku to Shibuya and ate some hot pot. Really good. All you can eat meat for 90 minutes, a side bar with salads, drink bar with matcha lattes?? and also dessert.

On Tuesday I ate at this sushi spot in Shibuya for the last time with the other intern. We splurged lol and tried some gold-flaked sushi. Good times. Gonna miss just eating food after work and strolling around Shibuya.

On Wednesday I went to Daiba to visit the Gundam base. I was quite disappointed. The stock was at least half of what they had when I visited in April 2023. Also, considering I had to come on a weekday, take a day off work, just to have the chance to ENTER the venue, was insane. Overtourism I suppose.

To clean up my sadness I just spent my time strolling around the mall and playing at the arcade. Playing MaiMai and taiko are things I will DEFINITELY miss out on. They lightened up my mood, especially considering that right before I lost 20-30 dollar on the crane machines... those darn things!

### Karaoke!??!
Sidenote- on Tuesday, since I had a lot of time I decided to go to Karaoke at around 9pm (Wednesday I was off work- so sleeping in was no problem). The staff asked for my student card and I told him I forgot it at home and that I was a university student in Canada. He said, no problem, we'll keep it a secret and I'll give you this student promotion. I couldn't read the kanji but I did understand it was a drinkbar.

Anyways I got my room receipt and was surprised to see my time ended at 5am- closing time. Wait.. had he given me free time? Free time meaning I can stay as long as I want until open. And hold up, I have unlimited soft drinks? I can order tea, pop, coffee, whenever?? AND DID HE SAY THE PRICE WAS 770YEN?

I WAS SOOO happy!!! This meant I could take my time searching for songs, translate the menu so that when my friends came I could teach them, and overall just relax between songs. And that I did. I even just stayed for half an hour watching Matthew play TFT lool. I'm definitely going back in a couple of days for this :)

Okay back to my main thoughts. Thursday I ate this amazing katsuya (called Maisen) with the other intern and of course it was great. We played Taiko and crane games afterwards and I met up with my cousin again to head to Don Quixote! I bought some things to give my family and the day ended normally.

I couldn't sleep that night for the life of me, and I think it's because I drank caffeine (matcha latte) with my cousin that day. So, I slept 6 hours and went into work at 9am for my last day of work. I was somehow able to lock in and finished one last task. Then, I created a fun graduation slideshow to present my coworkers. We also had lunch and dinner that day which were of course amazing. I actually left lunch early because I thought my exit interview was an hour earlier than scheduled- and I missed out on dessert. Whoops.

Saturday (yesterday) I hung out with my cousin again. We started in Akiba and I showed them my holy grail- TrioDX; k-pop official goods heaven. They went crazy! Love it~

We trekked to Shimbashi afterwards and had an amazing Wagyu kbbq. Our server was so cute and kind and even went out of the Japanese comfort zone and had small talk with us (in English; which to be fair her English was very good). Then for some reason every Karaoke near us wanted ID and one of us forgot out ID :(. So, we decided to go to Shinjuku for crane games. I couldn't find one I wanted to play so instead I played the hololive English ichiban kuji and I won... the top prize Gawr Gura visualboard. Crazy.

## What's next
Well, I have 3 days ish until my friends come, and I plan to do things that are better done while Japanese people work (i.e. when there's less people around). I'm going to go to a gaming cafe and play some counter strike and genshin. And I'm also going to go to Ikebukuro and hopefully check out all of k-books kpop without any troubles...

Lastly I need to move out of my apartment and pack (which I'm doing right after this!). Moving out will be just like the west, except that I need to attach garbage tags to my oversized garbage.

## Overall, rating?
What's my rating of my internship... hmm... I'll just do ratings with little elaboration (I'm feeling lazy)

Internship (Actual Work Experience, Career Growth): 8/10 - learned a lot of new tech

Japanese Lifestyle: 8/10 - super amazing. The missing two points are because of the things I miss from Canada- connections with friends, gaming, etc.

Hobbies: 100/10. Not much to say really. I'll miss Anime, K-pop and Trading Card shopping; a lot.

That's it really!

This will very likely be my last entry in this blog. I don't think I'll have the time to update it while vacationing with my friends, and quite frankly, I don't think those kinds of entries would be relevant to my internship experience that I've been writing about so far.

If you have somehow read all of my entries, I really do appreciate it.

Hopefully, one day when I grow up and mature even further I'll be able to look back on this blog and seriously appreciate the deep documentation I had of this experience. Until then, stay safe- future me!
