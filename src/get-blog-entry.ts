  "august-10": `# August 10
Well it finally happened. After a couple months of visa delay, I have finally arrived in Japan. Honestly, I feel like I should be happier, but the last few months silently drained me mentally. Believe me, it was great to sleep at 3am, and wake up at 11am everyday, and spend time goofing off with friends. But to spend each of those days wondering "will I ever make it to Japan?", it was draining. I softly always was angry at the delay, but I never chose to outlet that vent in any way, and it kind of just blew up on me a couple weeks ago. Mental drain can lead to physical symptoms people. Cut off that low-hanging stress that you have while you notice it. Don't let it pack up into a giant ball of worry that explodes at the worst time.

Anyways, let's talk about the real meat. I landed in Japan on August 9 at around 3pm, got my residency card and everything at Haneda which took an hour or so I'm not really sure. Took 3 different trains to my Airbnb and man it was a god damn hassle. I told myself that I would "tough it out" and make it to the Airbnb without eating and that was a horrible decision. Coupled with the heat and lack of quality sleep, when I finally got to the Airbnb I was drained like a dried plum. Funny enough my passcode to the room didn't work, though luckily the host opened it for me remotely and fixed the passcode. All in that time however, I was on the brink of what felt like extinction. Physical exhaustion that was pushed to the point of no appetite (which by the way, I had already had a low appetite from the aforementioned anecdote), alongside all the other situation-shock I had (_this_ was my going to be my life for the next 5 months). But yeah, the brain is fickle in that you always want to focus on the worst case possible alongside ignoring all the good things that happened on the way, downplaying everything you've worked for. Don't do that. Focus more on the good things, and the bad things will become tiny, rare, and almost obsolete grains of sand in your world that is a beachside.

Maybe this diary will become a good way of outletting. It's like the #vent-in-here-dudes channel my friends and I have, but this feels a bit more personal in the way I outlet.

Oh yeah August 10th (below) was spent in strong sun, with an average temperature of 35c that FELT LIKE 39c? 

Okay. Not everything was bad. Hardships are expected and they only exist to get you to your goals and aspirations. I spent August 10 (today) with a couple goals in mind: one was to just relax and go shopping which was something I was telling myself I would "save for Japan". Second was to get a physical IC card that wasn't this damned Welcome Suica. Third was to get physical comiket wristbands. I couldn't fulfill the second because there's a chip shortage and thus train companies have phased out giving out physical IC cards (but apparently welcome Suicas are fine??? :angry:). As for shopping, I got a Pokemon GO Plus which was cool. It's weird how it works because it's always vibrating but it is what it is. I also got a looooot of clothes from Uniqlo. A dress shirt, white and light jeans, shorts, and a 780 yen Oshi no Ko shirt, all for like $60 CAD. Just the jeans in Canada would be like $100 (maybe not the Uniqlo ones specifically but you know). As for the comiket wristbands, I started the day by going to the busiest Animate I've ever seen. Why are people lined up shoulder to shoulder to enter an Animate at 10am on a Saturday. It's like it's goddamned Heartland wingstop. Okay funny because I was one of those people lined up at 10am at Animate but whatever!! Went in, checked a bit and saw a sign saying "all C104 [comiket 104] items are sold out". Sad. Didn't think I would be able to find it considering the convention was the very next day :(. I went to Melonbooks and they had it lol. Only afternoon for day1 but I only care about day2 anyways (so I bought the morning one for day2). Honestly, I'm going to skip day1 after some thought. Sure, I lose 440 yen :'(, but I really really really don't want to succumb to heat exhaustion, and seeing how the past 2 (or 1.5) days have been, I might be on the way to it. Gonna spend August 11th just resting at home and checking out whatever is near my Airbnb (it seems a second-hand shop is nearby :eyes:). I'm also aiming to snack a bunch in lieu of calories in my real meals. Or honestly, I might aim to eat more frequent, smaller meals, but I'm lazy right now so I'm not sure... No shame in spending a day just resting. It's not like my wallet can handle shopping everyday anyways.

Good things that happened:
- Great sleep. No seriously I slept good until the sun woke me up at like 6am, but I'd slept at 9pm the day earlier so it works out.
- Konbini worker at 7-11 said my Japanese was good after I struggled a bit when she said something to me. Heartwarming and it really made my day
- Teishoku worker was the sweetest old lady ever. She guided me through a conversation with my broken Japanese, and we made some small talk! I thought Japanese people hated that stuff but it seems the experienced, mature citizens are the greatest. Also really made my day

Hopefully people aren't annoyed that I'm spamming them with messages or images or whatever it may be. It's my current way of outletting stress which is all just pinpointed at my physical health right now. It's gonna much better these past few days, but now I'm justifiably worried about heat exhaustion. I've spent the past few months inside with air conditioning, with pretty much no exercise or physical activity. Let's ease into it shall we?

As for the rest of my day (it's currently 8pm!) I think I'm going to start some seasonal animes (a taboo for me) and slowly unwind and get some good sleep. Let's hope for a successful comiket for me on Monday. Just praying I don't have to sit in the sun forever. Then it's my first day *at* work on August 13th plus signing my apartment August 14th. Move-in to my apartment is August 18th, which I'm 100% using a taxi for.

Til' the next one (if I don't update this again then hopefully I've settled in so nicely that Japan is a second home to me).

  "august-13": `# August 13
Oh baby, it's day after comiket day, and also my first day of work! Gonna keep this one short to rest up, since tomorrow I'm going to sign the lease for my apartment! No more Airbnb but that also means I need to buy furniture...

Okay comiket 104 (C104). Yo. Crazy. Like seriously. If you're a westerner and have never been to an Asian convention, let alone, comiket, believe me YOU ARE MISSING OUT. I don't think you could even reasonable trek through all of what there is to offer in a week. There's, what, like 12-14 different HALLS filled with corporate anime goodies, artist doujinshis, etc. I was there from open (11am) til 3:30pm and all I visited was 4 booths. Albeit I waited for a bit to get some stuff signed :) and to eat food! But man I would have been satisfied with just two of those booths. Life changing event for me and I really mean it.

First day of work. Fun! 42nd floor at Shibuya Scramble Square, met my fun coworkers, and chilled with some onboarding. After doing 4 co-ops previously, it gets mundane, but is necessary of course. Looking forward for the days to come.

Hoping my increased cardio helps to strengthen my body. I'm feeling much better until when I reallllllly exert myself. I'm not huffing and puffing for breath or anything, but I can feel that intense, heightened bloodrush that you usually get when you're doing the fattest leg press of your life. Okay exaggeration but you get me.

Good thing that happened today:
- Reliving comiket interactions!!
- Airpods are finally charging :pray: just took getting a new cable... Apple's iPhone cable they gave me doesn't work for it anymore :/
- Fun first day of work
- Social interactions

Nice stuff. We'll see when my next one is; perhaps the day of or after I move in?
`,

  "august-22": `# Whoops... kinda forgot lol
Alright. August 22nd, and it's been 5 days since I moved in. Been living too nicely not gonna lie that I kinda forgot about this diary. Anyways, let's do some retrospectives!

## Move-in day
August 18th? It was chill. Took a taxi about 15 minutes from my Airbnb to my new place. About $30 but much better than the 1 hour commute by train with all my goodies. Funny story, the building next to mine is Harmony Terrace II and I live at Harmony Terrace I. They decided to use the same room numbers and I tried to go into someone else's apartment at Terrace II. Hopefully they weren't mad :(. A part from that, I had to walk 750m to the Japanese IKEA (Nitori) and buy a futon for about $60 CAD. Then I had to carry it from there, up a pedestrian bridge, back to my apartment. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GAINED THE POWER TO DO IT. Set that thing up quickly and ordered uber eats. Greatest KFC of my life.

That reminds me, maybe I should add some photos! I'm too lazy to put it into the markdown itself but a photos folder should be fine... right?

## Days after moving in
Okay it's kind of a blur now because my brain forgets stuff it doesn't like/doesn't care about. The gist of it is that I needed to buy: a desk, a chair, mugs, plates, water filter, hangers, etc. For the desk and chair, I bought a folding desk and chair from Nitori and carried those babies back in one dash. I still don't know how I did it because I promise you I am malnourished (food tastes better now don't worry).

Water filter I ordered from Amazon >:). Mugs, plates, hangers I bought at the dollar store which was great! Been to the grocery store right below the dollar store too and I'm realizing how expensive convenience stores are now... At the grocery store, a half loaf of Japanese sweet bread runs me 170 yen. CRAZY.

The walk to the station to get to work is horrible, since it's about 1km away. However, the street district there is amazing. So much culture, a large variety of restaurants, shops, and dessert places that makes it all worth it. Like imagine this: I need to get to Akihabara (one train line away from said station) but I'm also hungry. Okay, go to the Doutor next to the station before heading out!

Oh yeah Japanese people are bit odd. I'm realizing now how that they probably don't like foreigners, but due to their culture, it's something that they are not direct about, even to me a "Japanese"-passing person (visually). Living here versus being a tourist really changes your perspective.

Oh yeah (x2). Living here logistically is a PAIN. Why do I have to sign SOOO many papers just to open a bank account/get an apartment? Why do I have to buy a physical stamp instead of signing with a pen? Why do I have to go to the City Hall and register my address? Which by the way, they don't even check. You can literally put a random address in the ward and they would accept it. Fine by me I did it before I moved in anyways... Also garbage. I like the heightened frequency but why are there so many different garbage days? Paper, plastic, combustibles, plastic bottles, non-combustibles. I understand why lazy people here have piles of garbage in their homes. I really do understand.

The only good thing is that living alone in Waterloo has prepped me well for this.

## Yesterday's... torrential downpour
So I wanted to treat myself after moving in by going to Tower Records and visiting the K-pop store; buying whatever album I wanted. I bought IVE's After Like mini album (or whatever you call it) for 30% off... 1800 yen. WHAT A STEAL! Felt great, left the store and I see rain. Alright, rain ain't anything new and I need an umbrella anyways. Went to the convenience store, bought an umbrella and made my way to the station. Oh. It's a torrential downpour. Heavy rain? FLOOD WARNING? Alright... let's go on the train. Oh yeah they're paused. Huh I'm dumb. Let's leave the station and walk to an anime store and stay there til the rain dies down. Bad idea, but I didn't want to wait in that packed station anyways. The streets of Shibuya were FLOODED. Like I'm talking half a foot tall puddles of water everywhere. My shoes got soaked. Lower pants: DRENCHED. I got to the anime store but I was too wet to enter. Sat on the floor and wrung out my socks to keep them as dry as possible (I am so sorry Mr/Mrs/Ms. Janitor). Still soaked. Waited like 40 minutes for the rain to die down then went to Don Quixote and bought some sandals (which I needed anyways). Could have gotten a larger size but it's fine, they're gonna be for indoors anyways. Had to take a different path home, but it was fine. Left work at like 5pm and got home at 9pm.

Well, that's a lesson hard-learned. My shoes are mostly dry now and I hope they're okay tomorrow since I'm going into work...

Most of today's diary entry really was just me ranting, but that's because I didn't do much this week. This weekend, is going to be great. Saturday will be Diver City Mall (the gundam mall). Going to visit Gundam base, buy some clothes, check out Tower Records, and just have a good time. Sunday will be my Akihabara day. Going to walk around the city as much as I can then end the day by purchasing a figure. Hopefully I find something rare or cheap!

Til' next time, maybe next week? Who knows... we'll wait until another big event happens!
`,

  "september-12": `# We are so back
It's been 1 month (and a bit) since I've landed... holy cow. Like literally I can't believe it. Things have been great! Appetite is good, I'm adjusting well to life here and so on and so forth.

## Intern Welcoming Party (and more!)
Epic. We had like a 4-course (very small courses) sukiyaki which was great. Unlimited drinks, so I tried Japanese beer which was tame, and also a cola highball. Beer was nice, highball got to me lol. Food was alright to be honest but just hanging out with my coworkers was super fun. We even had a second round, where 4-5 of us when to an Irish pub and continued drinking. I had a gin tonic which was GREAT by the way. Also had a rum cola which is a classic, and then finished off the night with a "spicy" ginger ale. Like you know how normal ginger ale is just super sweet syrup? Well, imagine a true ginger taste, like that of a ginger syrup in tofu pudding, carbonized. It was STRONG I tell you but honestly pretty nice.

Chatting with my coworkers here was super fun haha. Just a lot of teasing, ladyboy mentions (two of us are Thai!), and overall relaxing.

Oh yeah, and the very next day the other intern (Harry) and I went to Golden Gai, a famous tourist spot with hundreds of small drinking bars stacked next to each other. Super fun, about $20 for 2 drinks and a cola and we just spent the night chatting (in English) to the bartender, a couple from SF, a couple of Vancouver, and the nicest and coolest German living in South Korea.

## Takeaways
I've been having lots of fun haha. I think there's a lot of soul searching going on, as in, learning about myself. I am introverted in the sense that I do enjoy my own time and doing things in my own pace a lot, but I don't think I could be by myself forever. The interactions I have with my coworkers and the other intern at my company are more than enough to suffice my needs.

Go at your own pace. I feel like living in a new country, you almost feel like you want to try something new everyday, like a new meal or searching a new place. While that is great, watch yourself! Physically, mentally, and also financially. Also, there's no need to force yourself to eat something new everyday. Some people, like me, only really eat food cause we have to lol. While I enjoy eating new, delicious food, if I eat like that everyday, well for one, I'd become mentally exhausting searching for new places, and two, I would have no money in my bank account... for my hobbies that I actually enjoy. Take it at your own pace.

Lastly, spending. I'm trying to spend less on food and more on my hobbies, but damn it is too easy to indulge here. Food is food, you need it to live so I'm okay with going the extra mile to buy a good meal. However, my hobbies, Anime and K-pop. People. It's too easy to spend on your hobbies here. I can go to the convenience store and buy a pokemon pack for 180 yen, or an IVE ichiban kuji for 730 yen. Not a lot, but everyday? Yeah it adds up. I'm trying to watch my spending so that I can both enjoy these smaller things like pokemon packs, while also spending large on a figure here and there. Just saying... this wouldn't have happened in Canada lol. I just don't have access like that, which is both a blessing and curse I guess, and also means that my large purchases are a figure once in a while; something that is easily manageable when you live rent-free.

## Some other stuff
Hobbies have been tooooo fun here! Here's a list of things I've bought:
- lfrith jiu (p-bandai wfm gundam for 4500 yen HOLY)
- kpop photocards (haewon., IVE pokemon set!, haewon polaroid)
- kpop albums (crazy [balaclava, kazuha, chaewon], after like, stick out)
- pokemon booster box
- manga (nanas, houseki, dress up darling, gintama 1-3, sbr 1, so much more...)
- ive ichiji (file and keychain)

OK GOODBYE TFT TIME

  "september-23": `# Moving-In, One Month Retrospective

Yeah I'm using (project management) scrum terms, let's go! It's now been over a month since I've moved into my new apartment, and specifically today and yesterday I decided I wanted to vent lol. The weather is finally calming down, and with that the UV rays weaken, and true bliss returns to my life.

## Apartment Retrospective
One month! Dang! At this point I'm logistically settled, I have my desk, bed, chair, clothes hanging area, cutlery and plates, you name it. It's been chill, laundromat is about a 4 minute walk (faster if I speed walk) so even laundry is fine. About 600-800 yen each week ain't bad to be honest. Garbage I understand now, but recycling is a bit weird. Sometimes they take my plastics and sometimes they don't. Apparently there's other collection areas but it doesn't feel right to just leave a bag of plastics on the side of the street... so I just gamble each week. I really do appreciate how they have dedicated recycling days for bottles, cans, glasses, because it feels in a sense that recycling this way actually impacts the earth.

A few things leftover for me before I can finalize my routine. A couple days ago I paid my electric bill which was cool. You just bring it up to the convenience store, they scan it, and you pay like you would for a melon bun. I still need to pay my water and rent, which needs to be done by bank transfer at an ATM... and I'm dreading it (more on that below).

## Spending Changes
I got my salary for last month and it's rough. Like I'm talking 36% of my gross income was deducted for taxes and pension. Goodness. 36%? I'm not even making that much... do they have tax brackets here? I calculated the tax rate for my monthly salary in Canadian dollars, with a Canadian tax rate in Ontario and I would literally get taxed less in Canada. What happened to Canada being one of the top tax eaters, 6ixbuzz commenters? (Minor vent, sorry). Jokes aside, I'm just shocked really but when a lot of the deductible is for a pension, things start to line up, let's say.

Anyways after that reality check I realized that my daily food budget + rent + utilities is quite literally going to be exactly my take home pay. Yikes. That doesn't even include commuting costs, entertainment, etc. At least my commute to work is covered, but everything else? I mean, I'm on a staycation right? I can't just stay at home all day, and as great as the transit system is here in Japan, it still _costs_ money. 318 yen one way to Shibuya, 178 yen one way to Ikebukuro; it all adds up. So yeah, any entertainment, like buying merchandise or a guilty pleasure (gachapon, crane games) comes out of my pocket! Not a problem, if I were here for only a month instead of five months in total. And I still need a graduation trip... with what funds? Not the funds from this co-op! Don't even get me thinking about tuition and rent on my last school term.

So yeah, I'm trying to limit my extra spending now which means I need to spend my free time doing activities that don't cost money. Yeah right, me? Seriously? When I'm surrounded my Japanese Anime goods? Fine, I'll just cut back on my food budget, save what I can here and there and use that extra money on myself. Of course, I'm still going to take money from my Canadian bank to buy the things I want. Where will that money come from? My savings for school. I'm mortgaging my enjoyment here with my future. I guess that's why they call it a mortgage- make no mistake however, I am not as financially instable as I am making myself out to be right now.

## Vents, and I'm Not Talking About Air Ducts
Haha. Alright minor vent time, and let me preface I am NOT trying to throw shade at anyone or any society, just laying out my thoughts. Japan is an amazing society. Seriously. Super advanced, great food, it's cheap! Why doesn't everyone move here? Well... as advanced as the country is, why do I have to use cash? How come when opening a bank account you only give me a card to WITHDRAW cash (I can't even use it to pay for goods). Food is great yes, but you're missing so many vegetables and fruits... because they're, expensive? It's so cheap living here! Well yeah, maybe if you're not in Tokyo. If we use our brains a bit, with a lower cost of living, means a lower salary for every worker. Why do you guys think people in California and New York get paid way more than Canadians? Well when rent is $4000 a month for a bed and maybe a closet you can probably figure that out for yourself.

Okay buy my main rant really boils down to: am I really a part of this society? I speak, conversational Japanese. Much better than most tourists and certainly more than someone who "just watches Anime all day." But everytime I speak it I feel like somethings missing. Conversing really is about connecting yourself with the other party, but I feel like my words fall flat due to there being an invisible... barrier. A difference between me and the regular 日本人. I'll let you guys connect the dots but this all circles back to my experience first trying to open a bank account. I brought the forms, ID, work contract signed, and the staff tell me "we're closing soon [in over an hour]. Could you return with someone who speaks fluent Japanese and we can try again?" What? I brought all the forms... do I really need to speak that much Japanese? Is my Japanese not enough? It was fine at the city office... and the forms, that's all the information you need from me! Well, I work in Shibuya, a 40 minute train from here, I am sure as heck not dragging my coworkers HERE to help me. Let me go to the one in Shibuya- which they let me; which I find odd, considering I was told to go to my nearest bank office to open my account lol. Oh yeah, only one bank in Japan lets foreigners open bank accounts! Japan Post Bank! Have fun being an international student here!

Oh, and did I mention that I have to pay for my rent through bank transfer? And that I can't do it online because I can't switch my apple ID to Canada because I have iCloud? That means I have to go to an ATM! Fine, oh wait, I have to return to that dreaded bank from above. Oh yeah and why not screw me over again, each transfer above 50000 yen costs 440 yen, and below costs 220 yen. I'm down 660 yen just for paying my bills. Splendid. Absolutely pristine I might add.

For all the amazing experience I have here, I always miss something back home. And this week, it's the feeling of being connected that I always feel in Canadian society.

### Thailand...?
Yep, got my manager's approval and now I'm waiting for the legal/HR team to approve my request. About a week there and honestly I'm content with just eating food there haha. Fruit in Japan is too expensive and well, in Thailand, it's cheaper than water... and tastes incredible.

  "september-24": `# BACK TO BACK BABY
Yes that's right. Back to back updates WHATTT??? For each vent, a blessing (I'm not sure what the opposite of a vent is) must be given back!

## Rrrrrrrrent
Alright it was fine. Actually it was amazing. A super sweet lady helped me through both my transactions at the ATM. Honestly she went above her pay-grade, going as far as to confirm that everything in my transaction was correct before I went through with it. I want to add that the ATM had an English version but it really wasn't that descriptive, which is why I asked for some help. Honestly, it went super smooth so I'm very glad with it.

## Dermatologist Experience
I've had a lot of sun spots appear on my skin which worried me a bit. Since I have insurance from my company, I thought why not get it checked out. Holy, there are so many clinics over here. No wonder their health care is so good. Obviously Japanese education is a level above even in Western standards, but the sheer abundance is really reassuring. I was able to register as a new patient, and complete my check-up in less than an hour. Maybe 30-40 minutes if I really counted. The receptionist, doctor, and nurse were all very caring in knowing that my Japanese health-term knowledge is very limited. The doctor herself also translated a statement with a lot of health terms using Google translate which was very nice. Super happy with my experience and I wish them all the best.

How does it compare to Canada? I guess with my family doctor, about the same, minus the registering part obviously. Getting a new family doctor is very hard in Canada right now and I honestly believe it's due to a lack of doctors, and an uptake in the number of people looking for doctors. What will always be the hardest thing about being a Canadian is knowing that for professionals, America is just much better pay-wise. I mean, yeah you lose your universal health care sucks, but if you're making let's say 300k USD a year and are receiving benefits on top of that, paying for your own health care really isn't much. Obviously it's a different story if you're living paycheck to paycheck or are earning around the median. That's the biggest thing Canada should change: aiming to retain our top professionals. Engineers, IT members, healthcare providers. And as such, we should as citizens respect those professionals.

That last sentence really is just me ranting about how many of the people I know want to move elsewhere, and speak of it as this magical experience that is smooth, easy, and simple! I mean let me give you a great anecdote: I was at Golden Gai in Shinjuku, drinking with some Americans. Rich ones, they live in San Francisco and one of them was an HR professional for a tech company. They told me that their goal was to move to Canada; interesting isn't it? Canadians want to move to America and Americans want to move to Canada. The grass is different on the other side, greener or not.

Anyways I don't want to become to political and the such but I think dumping out your thoughts once in a while is a decent idea.

Til' the next one!

  "october-15": `# ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM
No, I did not forget. I've just been busy of course!

## September 30
So, that was my birthday! Weirdest one I've had... I got sick. Not bad sickness just your regular sneezing and running nose, but it took like a week to resolve :/. Could have been worse so no complaints. It was a Monday and I spent the day working and recovering from sickness. Normal I guess, except I didn't celebrate, and not even on my own. Mainly because I was sick and didn't want to force myself. Ordered a pizza from Dominos, which costed like $11 with discounts (without discounts it would have been $35 for the smallest pizza 'Medium' I've ever seen). Dinner was just ramen; no cake, no sweets just ramen.

After that Monday I spent the rest of the week just recovering from sickness. My team was very okay with it and told me to focus on recovery; so I just left my work laptop on for notifications, and did work here and there for smaller, spread out intervals. Good stuff.

Saturday was cool, my sickness was mostly resolved but not fully. I'd decided that I wanted to spend the day going around Akiba and buying stuff for myself. Thankfully my friends sent me some cash so I used most of it to cover some nice items I'd be eyeing on! Rem & ram childhood version nendoroids (set), Kana Arima nendoroid, and a Yukihana Lamy nendoroid! From my own pocket I bought two Haewon photocards, two ichiban kuji plays for the Genshin event. And throughout the week before (so September 30-October 4) I also bought some manga, and an NMIXX album for myself.

Sunday was also cool! I went to Ikebukuro and picked up two booster boxes for Pokemon (crimson haze and the new paradise dragona), some cheap manga, a Karina photocard (gundam.), and lastly, one of the best, a $30~ Ram prize figure that I've literally been looking for since I've landed. The price was exactly what I expected and I knew that the first one I saw, I would be without a doubt. Worked out well it was my 'spend and focus on myself' weekend!

The booster box pulls were alright. Crimson haze I got an SR magcargo ($3~) and from dragona I got the SAR tera type alolan exeggutor which looks AMAZING ($30~). I'm still opening the paradise dragona box, one pack at a day! 

## October 15
Okay so today I went to the NMIXX pop up in Shibuya, Tokyo. Crazy cause I work in that city and I know it pretty well. Even crazier that they have a pop-up in Tokyo out of all places, considering I haven't seen a single advertisement with any member of NMIXX, let alone any good advertising in the music stores. Like for instance, Tower Records had KATSEYE advertised at the top of the escalator (you can't avoid it), while NMIXX got a tiny little end-of-aisle for their album debut.

Anyways, so if you spend 11000 yen ($110~ CAD) on goods (no albums) you get a CHANCE at winning from a few prizes (1 of 6 signed polaroids, 3 signed mini discs, 1 of 6 acylic keychains, polaroids, stickers) where the first 3 are limited to one person each 😵. I spent $65 cad on goods, so another 50 would have brought me to the threshold. Apparently the drawstring bag was delayed and I didn't even know! That would have brought me to the threshold since I would have bought the drawstring bag for sure. Sad :( I'll go back to get the drawstring and perhaps debate if spending $65 for a CHANCE at a polaroid is worth it 🤔.

Nonetheless, I should be happy that I even had the chance to attend, since it was purely luck really. Plus, I'm already very content with what I got! I guess that's why companies do these promotional things, to target victims like me into spending more 😭

![Kyujin and Jiwoo album bonuses](../pics/oct-kyujin_and_jiwoo.jpg)
## THAILAND
GOING TO THAILAND SOON!!! It's been SIX (6) years since I've gone and I'm super excited. Will be there with family from Canada (parents, aunt) and of course my Thai family. Honestly I've been there a lot so sightseeing isn't a main priority. As such, I'm just going to spend it eating Thai food, tropical fruits, Thai desserts, and hunting for kpop albums!

### Takeaways
Other than that, most of my days are spent the same. Some days I'll work then spend my evenings unwinding by watching Worlds 2024 or watching anime, while other days (namely weekends but some weekday evenings), I'll spend anywhere from 2 to 6 hours in a city window-shopping. I really like Ikebukuro since it was K-pop and Anime, and of course other shops like clothing places H&M, Uniqlo. But on evenings or days where I only want to spend a bit of time there, I'll go window shopping in Akihabara. I usually make sure to check out amiami figure tower for rare secondhand figures, Lashinbang, Trio DX (for photocards), and any trading card shops I walk by. Right now I'm trying to collect all of crimson haze JP! I just need the SRs and SARs now... which will run me easily $300 cad... thanks Greninja...

Take care, I'll try to write another entry while in Thailand! Nov3-16 :)

  "october-21": `# Holy Moly Guacamole!
Today's entry... is just because I have too much time today hehe. I'm trying to remember what I talked about last week lol. Already talked about the NMIXX pop up, but did I say... I went again!??!

## NM(II)XX
II because it's the second time. Ok so I went again like I said I would. I bought the drawstring bag which was tiny as heck! But whatever. I also bought the mini pouch because I really didn't want the buttons or pens. That brought my total to ~8000 yen which for myself I am content with. However, shoutout to the big boy Adam, for whom I bought a Lily keychain for and reached the 11000 yen threshold!! LUCKILY I won the polaroid (a copy of the signed one) and not a sticker, and now I am the proud owner of a gorgeous signed Lily polaroid! Super, duper worth it. Also for each 5500 you spend on goods, they give you a special photocard, and I got Bae and Lily. Sweet! Almost lucked out like a demon but the free sticker from the event (spend 5500, upload a picture to SNS, enjoy the fan zone) got me the same sticker I got from the first day... no complaints for a free item though, now a friend can have it :)

## Karaoke.
Alright I don't know what I've been doing with my life. After my first ever concert, IVE, I realized that man concerts are fun as hell if you go with friends/to artists that you enjoy enough. Well, I went to Karaoke last Friday for my first time ever and man... these Japanese party hard loooool.

Okay the context is we have a new parttimer (university student who is about to graduate), and one of our team members is doing an internal transfer to HR. We had samgyeopsal (I think I spelt that right) which is like a sort of tabletop KBBQ. Team dinners here are fun as always and it was nice eating a fat quantity of food and chatting with the mates. I drank 1 cocktail (as opposed to like 3 from my own welcoming party).

Afterwards we walked around and went to a nearby Karaoke place. So fun. What the heck!?!? I think alcohol makes things better (I had a gin tonic this time). Sang some Taylor Swift, crossing field, Idol (YOASOBI, which I failed at), and chimed along when others were whipping out some Japanese classics. There are wayyy too many songs which is why I really enjoyed it. I could sing a familiar English song, while jamming out to an Anime song I almost know by heart, and finishing with a Japanese song where I sight read the furigana. Also the new parttimer is a demon. Like in a good way. Bro CRANKED a hoshimachi suisei song and Idol when we attempted. Hell yeah.

You know what of the things I really appreciate here is that because people are so focused on themselves, they really don't care about you. As in, I can really be outgoing and forward with my hobbies; I don't need to be shy in singing an Anime song at Karaoke because it's so common here to just really like these kinds of things. In Canada, I wouldn't even dare to be heard in public singing an Anime song; like it's that idea of people thinking you're weird. But in Japan, being 'weird' is normal. Harajuku fashion here is commonspace, no one cares that you look like a character out of a dream, you're just a person. You can have an oshi bag filled with 100 of the same pin and people would literally not care. That's why I'm able to indulge in my hobbies so deeply here; it's just, well, accepted!

Obviously the idea of people not caring about you goes both ways, but let's just focus on the "you can be yourself and no one will bat an eye" aspect of it.

### Closing Remarks
Yeah not really much happened since last week. I bought a few more pokemon cards to continue finishing my crimson haze set but that's it. Also continuing to finish my chihayafuru collection, currently at, oh damn, like 13 volumes? There's like 50... I gotta pick up the pace otherwise January is gonna get here FAST.

Anyways, Thailand soon. Work is going well. Food is food (if it's edible that's enough for me). Dessert is YUM! Konbini food is so convenient when I'm hungry at 10pm. Also, FlyQuest did great!

Okay cyas~
`,

  "november-2": `# Thailand!
Been two weeks, time for an update! Nothing really in particular happened, but tomorrow I'm heading out to Thailand! Gotta wake up at 330am... so that I can shower, eat, and catch the first Skyliner to Narita Terminal 2. That'll get me there at around 626am, which should give me a decent amount of time to get to my gate by 830am.

## Purchases
Money. Okay I try to limit my spending but things happen :(. A summary of my purchases has been the new ILLIT album, aespa's new album, a bunch of pokemon cards to finish my Crimson Haze set, a subaru nendoroid (which I've been hunting FOR YEARSSSSSSS LETS GOOO + it was the cheapest I'd ever seen it)

## Worries?
It's not good to worry a lot about small things, as they'll often compound into a low-hanging stress that you don't take proper care of. So, for me I'm just going to vent out here. I guess my current worries are booking accommodations for when my friends come to Japan, and well making it to Thailand lol. Okay that's not supposed to be gruesome, rather than I just want to be there on time, and get my special re-entry permit so that I can return to Japan with no issues. I should know that it will all be fine honestly, but when I have as much time as myself right now, it really lets you get wild with your inner thoughts. All will be good in a couple of days :); plus, the accommodations really aren't that bad when you just realize that Tokyo is expensive.

### Yatta
Well I am super excited for Thailand! As I've previously stated I'm really just looking forward to munching down on Thai food, Thai desserts, and FRESH FRUITS!!! AHHHH lets goo!!! Probably going to limit my shopping a part from I guess some plushies! Nesoberis to be exact.

Anyways, take care y'all! Every day, something big or small gets better for you, so don't let the bad things swamp over the good things!
`,

  "november-22": `# We are so back
Back from Thailand, landed back November 16 in the evening. Lots to unwrap so let's just do it!

## Thailand Takeaways
Worth it, it hindsight. Okay I say in hindsight because I had a horrible case of diarrhea midway through the trip. By horrible, I really just mean I needed to go to the bathroom frequently to let out a barrage of liquid waste, NOT number 1. I thought I was going through the thick of it (haha...) but in hindsight it wasn't bad. Not sure what I ate that made me go crazy but it was chill, and in all honestly, a kind of detox??

Anyways. The main takeaway I have from going to Thailand is that Thai food is WAYYY better than Japanese food. Like seriously, Japanese food, if you really look at it, is just super simple, well-crafted food. I'm not a hater, it's edible and affordable. But you know what else is edible and affordable, oh and tastes incredible? Thai food.

Seriously. Take a step back after you purchase a regular meal in Japan. Maybe a beef bowl, ramen, bento box, whatever. Anything that isn't "luxury." What do you see? Often it's just some sort of carbs with meat. Where's the vegetables? Sauce? Take a bite. Do you often get an explosion of flavours that makes you think "man I'm going to miss this." - I only get this feeling when I eat luxury food, I'm talking like over $20 CAD for the meal. WHICH IS EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A WAGE IN YEN. LIFE HERE AS A REGULAR PERSON IS SO MUCH MORE DIFFERENT THAN AS A TOURIST. I don't know, I don't think I could eat like I am right now in Japan forever. I need fruits. I need to feel like what I'm eating is fulfilling calorie-wise and vitamin-wise.

Okay back to Thai food. I mean... come on, have you tried Thai street food? It's cheap. Like 2-3 dollars cheap. And better than most regular food I'll get in Japan. I had a feast everyday for breakfast, and it ran my whole family $7 a day. I had congee, sticky rice, fried meats, Thai desserts, soy milk. Like a literal feast as if it was my last supper. Then comes real meals. I mean I don't think I'd eaten that much food in one sitting since going to sushi, IN AUGUST. First night I was there I just chowed down on crab fried egg, fish, fried rice, stir fried vegetables, tom yum soup, and dessert. I felt like a king, and I want to feel like that daily.

Of course there was sooo much more Thai food but I can't go explaining everything. What I can explain is that Thailand, whether it be the city of Bangkok or a tourist town of Kapri or Pattaya, has exponentially more food options than Tokyo. Name a fast food chain. Thailand has it. American, Filipino, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, everything. There was a Maisen. That's one of the LUXURY food joints I have here in Japan. And it was in Bangkok. Oh yeah and affordable pizza! $10-15 mmmm, but there's more. The chefs there were trained by a retired Italian chef. That pizza was damn good, and it's a shame that pizza in the west is just fatty pieces of bread with dipping sauce, when in reality, real pizza actually tastes like a delicacy.

Alright what I'm realllly getting at is that Thailand has better tasting food overall, is about as affordable, has way more options, and actually allows you to affordably consume fruits, vegetables, and desserts. But then again, I was a tourist, not a person working there, so take that with a grain of salt- oh and many of the places I ate at were priced like it was a Canadian restaurant- they were damn expensive for a regular Thai person.

Finally, don't get me wrong. Tokyo and Japan are great places to live, but sometimes, it doesn't hurt to want _more_.

### Takeways, but not food
Too hot. Alas I think my body is moving from that of a child to an adult, finally? I mean, the heat just drains me. Both in August here in Tokyo, and last week in Bangkok. And that's fine, we're not built like machines. Knowing your limits and how to avoid poor situations is what learning is all about.

I complained about my 'health' (which again wasn't even that bad), and the heat, but it really was worth it for me to go to Thailand. Last time was 6 years ago and the next time, well who knows? If I'm flying from Canada to Asia, chances are I'll go to Japan, not Thailand. And seeing how much things have changed, for the city, and for the family members I reconnected with, really was an experience I'll probably not see for a while.

Lastly, I think my favourite touristy place was Pattaya. Bangkok is home. So much to do, but Pattaya feels like a place made for tourists. The selection of food was incredibly superb, and the nightlife really rounds off the place. I highly recommend visiting this seaside town if you want to go to Thailand- Bangkok is only 3 hours away by car!

## Now what?
Let's recount the days since I've landed from Thailand. On the first day (November 16, evening), I was able to skip the LOOONG visitor visa line and go straight to the 4 person re-entry permit line. From here to the skyliner (the high speed train taking me back to Tokyo from Narita), it was probably 15 minutes, lol. So damn quick, I love it!

Taking the Skyliner was chill, nothing much, and the walk back to my apartment was about the same. Ate Matsuya, rested, and slept late at like 2am and woke up late (at 10am... okay not late but it is what it is).

Spent the next day just resting at home and catching up on the 3 animes that I didn't watch while in Thailand (rezero, 2.5, and danmachi). ReZero is cooking btw please watch it!

Wasn't jetlagged or tired so I decided to go into the office on Monday (Nov 18), which was also chill. Just grinding away til our release. Tried pork belly at Matsuya which is amazing by the way... definitely try it. Some ice cream, then running to donki for some skin products that Thai security clearance took from me (angry face). Closed off my day by visiting Mandarake (nothing bought) and then also Tower Records. I was planning to buy NMIXX's ad mare album, but I saw aespa's armageddon album got restocked!! And then I realized STAYC's GPT Japanese version got released and I was like alright, I'll get aespa and NMIXX later (coping), and grab STAYC's album for the pre-order bonuses. Greatest idea ever. I won the gacha and got an extra photocard of Sieun, and an ISA photocard and sticker to add on top! Nice!

Day after (yesterday) I went to Akihabara and that's when I realized I am physically drained. Idk just felt tired and not really dizzy but pseudo-dizzy (vertigo-ish). Didn't feel like I was gonna knock out randomly and throw-up but it was just one of those, man my eyes are so damn tired my brain wants to turn off-kind of moments. Anyways I quickly grabbed another pokemon card for my crimson haze master set, and a couple of Moka photocards because trio dx restocked them :))) - finally some affordable Moka cards! Been waiting ;_;

As for today, just resting, needing my body to readjust to life here. It's sooo cold and when I landed mentally/physically it didn't click because I was expecting any weather colder than Thailand (about low 30s, celsius). Well, it's like 7-10 degrees celsius daily here, plus wind, which is a HUGE shock on my body. So rest it is. Also, if I keep stressing about not feeling good (when in reality I actually feel decent), then I'm just going to feel even worse mentally.

I'll probably do a quick bookoff run tomorrow to continue collecting all volumes of Chihayafuru. Oh yeah, I sent off my shipment of 37 manga volumes and my genshin cup. Honestly it was really easy to do. I bought the parcel box from the post office, and filled out all the logistics online (in English). Print a QR code after this to the post office, which prints the printing label (for free!) and then some logistical stuff like signing and things like that and your package is sent off (after paying of course).

My package weighed 5600 g, which is like 11-12 pounds for the imperial people. Shipping that costed 5500 yen ($50~ CAD). It seems expensive, and yes it is, but for the amount of weight I'm saving to haul back in my luggage, plus considering each Manga costed around 110 yen, it's actually pretty affordable. I'm talking like 200-300 yen for each volume of manga. You do the thinking there.

Anyways looking at all my stuff, and honestly as long as I don't go crazy on the figures (which I won't, I have no space), I should be more than able to fit everything in two luggages.

## The real closing remarks
In Thailand, I missed Tokyo. And in Tokyo, I miss my home in Canada. But coming back to Tokyo, I miss my time in Bangkok. Circular, funny! It's not healthy to think about what you've lost, but rather to think about what you gained and what you really enjoyed, which makes me really want to cherish the last 7 weeks-ish I have here in Tokyo. I don't want to force myself to go and do things for the sake of doing things, but just to be a little bit more pragmatic. My friends are coming in literally one month... which is going to be super fun. So for now, I'm going to enjoy the things in Tokyo that I like to do on my own, like spending long hours in card shops, and secondhand book stores.

_Once I leave Tokyo, graduate, and move on with life, the valuable memories, not matter how small, will last a lifetime; and I honestly couldn't complain one bit_

  "december-1": `# We woo wammus
Just a bored Sunday evening, not much has happened but I'll recount the interesting ones!

## Shibuya, Tuesday, 151
I went into the office to lock in and grind out some final features for our full stack app. I honestly don't even remember what I did but it worked out in the end and both our DEV and QA deployments were up and running. Good stuff.

After the work day finished I grabbed tsukemen with my intern coworkers. Had a great chat, talking about the experiences of the Japanese new grad who went to school in America. Once we said our goodbyes, I headed to the Pokemon Center Shibuya with one goal: purchase some packs of surging sparks to open. Well, I got more than I bargained for. Pokemon 151 singles were in stock. Bought 5 and the pulls were... lackluster. Two exes and just holos. I guess the low pull rates weren't a lie. All good- this week Terastal Festival releases, and along with it the coveted eeveelution lines. Hopefully this fares better!

## An offer appears
Ah-ha. So something cool happened between last entry and this one. I talked about how I would reminisce my time in Japan once I left. Well, it turns out instead of reminiscing, I have the chance to continue it. One of the technical managers on my team reached out and said that a new position is being created in our area, and that my division manager immediately looked to offer the position to me. It'd be a new grad role, and I'd probably be coming back in July/August but working in a C# focused role.

This actually aligns very well with the technology I want to work with throughout my career: C#, distributed systems-focused applications. I have a strong basis in it, and its features intrigue me with respect to the programming areas that look cool to me: distributed computing and parallelism.

Anyways, now I'm sort of conflicted. I have a verbal offer from my previous co-op in Waterloo, and so my choices are now twofold. 

Firstly, I can take the Waterloo position, continue the life that I've known my whole life, build up some savings by living at home, and see where things take me in a couple of years. By choosing to stay in Canada, I have the opportunity to find new, exciting, and higher-paying positions every year, and not to mention the ability to work my way over to California, if I really want to. Additionally, the benefits, work-life balance, type of work, and the team I worked in was quite honestly the best I've experienced.

Secondly of course is to return to my current, Tokyo-office-based company. I'd be plunging back into the life I currently live, but hopefully with some changes. I honestly don't think I could continue the current life I'm living forever. I would probably develop some mental health issues, in the sense that my apartment is NOT a suitable living space. Temporary, okay that's fine, but definitely not for years on end. I have 11m^2. I have no living room. I have no over, no microwave. I have no space to store my merchandise, which I absolutely love purchasing. In-fact, if I stayed here in Tokyo I'd be giving up a lot of personal space at home as opposed to my Canadian lifestyle. In all honestly, I might even give up on my collecting hobbies if I stayed here into the foreseeable future. Why should I collect Anime Figures, and Kpop albums that I can't display? That's again my pessimistic side appearing, so let's stay hopeful for now. In conclusion really, it depends on the compensation package. Benefits and salary. I'd need enough to rent at least a studio, save money, and spend on my hobbies at will. I'd want to get a car here, while enjoying what the city has to offer on weekends.

The unknown is the scariest thing in life. What will life be like in 1 years, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years? Things change, and throughout my life I have hated change. I don't like changing my lifestyle, and when things go out of the schedule I have in my head, it messes with my rhythm and quite frankly ruins my mood. But, oddly enough, when weighing my two options I'm somehow at ease. I don't feel stressed, or worried. I feel like this decision is the biggest crossroad I will ever encounter in my life, but it doesn't scare me, because really, both options are amazing.

When I was in middle school I was worried that I'd enter university and not find a job after graduating. This is still very true for a lot of people today, and even more so during the downsizing in the tech industry. Sometimes I forget that my truest goal in university was to just get a job. And now that I'm faced with the truth that I in fact have to options, deep down, I think that's why I'm at ease- the little guy hanging on my shoulders was knocked away by two angels.

I guess what I could really do is work in Japan for however many years I feel like, then return to Canada. Networking is an amazing thing, and I can reach out to my previous manager down the line. A small worry to me is if my experiences in Japan will translate into the tech mecca of the world, North America. But in truth, it will. Maybe (pessisimistically saying) not as much, but it's not like it's worthless. Again, pessimism.

I think at the end of the day my options are: continue my current life and my current goals: get a car- or dive back into a familiar life, and find new short-term and long-term goals.

(Oh yeah, and I had another interview this week for a new grad role that a recruiter reached out to me for. It's a Toronto-based company with a starting base salary of 90-110k, with benefits. Super intriguing, but I really need to refresh on my leetcode if I want a chance at this job. I didn't know where to fit this in, so take it here as a footnote)

## Friday Night Lights
So we (okay not me the other intern) presented the web app to the Finance division at the townhall. I think it was very well received. There were no issues and everyone else loved talking to the other intern about the app (I just stood there because I'm a chill guy I guess). Afterwords, me and him and his friend went to a nearby sushi place we hit up earlier in the year. I don't know why but it tasted 10x better than the last time. Frankly, tuna is amazing.

Afterwards, we grabbed gelato and chatted a bit. Took a stroll around the city looking at a christmas display on a building roof (it was worth it). Chatted a bit then went to karaoke. Super fun, and I don't think the west can compare. I haven't even been to one but I know n the west karaoke is something like double the price, which is a wallet drainer. For us it was 700yen per hour + drinks, during a high-demand time. Not bad for Tokyo. Also, I recommend continuously ordering drinks otherwise your throat WILL die.

## Saturday in Daiba
The same band of three from Friday moved on over to Daiba on Saturday. Not much happened really. We ate at the food court, then ran the arcade for probably two hours. The other intern spent maybe 2000 yen trying to get this Pekora pillow- which he did! So many tries, walking around, resetting the mind and continously returning to try it in probably 3 playing sessions really did bring out a dub for the boys. I can only imagine the elation he went through; is what I would say if I didn't win anything! I decided I also wanted to win something, so I tried the pokemon plushies for about 500 yen in total. There was this tiny fast spinning one which was too much for me mentally. I tried the bigger ones but the technique wasn't there for me. Screw it then, let's try the double-pole, flat laying anime one. First two tries: misses. Next one, huh I turned it a bit. Looking good. Next one, more turning... good. Next one, BOOOM, MASHA HAS DROPPED. What a MOMENT for me. I never thought I would win one of those games, but luck turned out to be on my side this week. Super, duper happy, and it's a figure I'll probably never sell.

Afterwards we ran some games. Taiko, maimai, some guitar hero one where all three of us played in a band (guitar, bass, drum). Fun stuff. Finished off the day walking around Daiba looking at the view. Highly recommended at night, since you can look across the bay over to the downtown Tokyo. There's a bridge and nice illumination within Daiba. Oh, and way less people than downtown Tokyo.

Oh yeah I opened a case hardened kukri knife this week. Field tested with the 'gold gem' pattern on the playside- if it's even worth anything. Thanks Ivan!

That's it for now. I'm hungry and it's TFT time!

  "december-11": `# A Regular Update
Heyo~

Not much has happened since my last entry, but it's been long enough for an update. While it'd be nice for every update to have a new thing, sometimes normal, regular, mundane entries are more than enough.

## Solo Adventures
Last Friday was a chill one. I decided I wanted to relive my crane game winnings by heading out to Akabane for the night. I tried my hand again, but this time at Gigo... and well, it didn't go well. The crane wasn't really that strong and would its claw would often twirl, leaving me with attempts that were far off what I wanted.

Well, to move past a sad thing, you might want to try something happier. The night wasn't really a failure after all. Before hand I headed out to book off to try and complete my Chihayafuru collection, but unfortunately there were no more volumes for me to purchase. However, the book store is always a happy place and I will never complain about being able to look through their catalogue. What really made my night was firstly getting to try a McDonalds drink that I'd been dying for. It was like an ice frappe, strawberry flavour with whipped cream and strawberry bits. Worth it :).

Secondly, however, was solo karaoke! After hopping off the train near my apartment, I was walking home and remembered that the Karaoke box my coworkers and I went to in October had a location at my train station. I said, screw it, Karaoke was so fun last week ('Friday Night Lights'), and singing always uplifts me- let's run some solo karaoke!

I think what's great about living far from downtown Tokyo is that the people are super nice. The lady was helpful and more friendly than the Shibuya location, which made the atmosphere enjoyable. I decided to go with 30 minutes (to test soloing!) and a warm Oolong tea for the night. It costed me 1100 yen, and was well worth the fun; I was running out of English songs to sing at the end!

One thing I could have wished for was having my room on the higher floors. She assigned me a room on the floor, right in front of the reception desk. Not really a big deal for me, but when the rooms aren't truly soundproofed, being on the main floor isn't really the coolest. Plus, when the staff brought me my drink, I think the whole city could hear I was listening to Cruel Summer.

## A New Experience
I just remembered my fun Monday night experience! I decided to stay home this day, and so I went out of my comfort zone and headed to a highly rated traditional sushi place near my house. Expensive, I knew, but my time here is coming to an end, so why not enjoy it a bit.

A entered the place about 15 minutes after opening (5:45pm), and of course it was empty. This was exactly what I wanted. I took a seat by the counter and was provided the menu. The menu itself was a vertically-written, traditional menu with no pictures. Not a problem but I can't read Kanji, and I don't know the names of fishes in Japanese. So, I asked the staff to explain to me the menu (noting that I speak little Japanese) and both her and the sushi chef were kind enough to provide me a detailed, simple explanation of the menu. There were rolls (makis) on the left, and regular fish + sushi on the right (nigirizushi).

I ordered the 10 piece platter that they recommended. This platter had 3 makis and 7 nigirizushis. Taste-wise, definitely better than any chain I've had here, and good enough for me to say "you have to try the sushi in Japan!" What really made this meal delicious though, was the presentation. There were flowers spread across the plate, garnishes, and an arragement that created a simple eating flow. Left to right, or the opposite!

In addition to the meal, I had one of my favourite Japanese conversations here. Once the chef said "your Japanese is more than good enough," I believe they became comfortable enough to hold small talk and extended conversation with me. Three staff worked here that day and we exchanged chats about life in Japan, life in Canada, things we like, the taste of the food, what items in the restaurant were, and so much more. These sort of conversations with strangers was what I missed a lot in Canada, and I was so grateful to be able to hold some chats like that here in Tokyo, right by where I live.

To top off my night, I told them I'd never tried (Japanese) sake and that I would like to order some. They gave me a shot-glass size of a sake to have. Worth it. The sake was softly sweet (lightly) with not a strong alcohol taste. I couldn't tell the alcohol percent, but I knew for sure exactly why salarymen could drink this every night after work. Then it kicked in and I realized it was probably around the strength of soju lol. Japanese alcohol is DEADLY my friends!

To think it could not get better- it could. After about 90 minutes, I told the staff I was ready to leave (and purchase some dessert :) ). They told me the Sake was a service (on the house), and I told them my thanks! I really couldn't believe the hospitality I received, and I don't think I'll ever find the words to fully describe it~ The meal costed me about 2000 yen for just the 10 pieces of sushi, but it felt like I'd been given a priceless meal.

### Rambling
Okay I really rambled on today. Maybe last week wasn't as boring as I thought. Take care everyone :) til the next one!
`,

  "december-22": `# Finished.
Wow. 4 months and 1 week later, and I'm already done my 8 month internship in Japan.

Okay if this is your first read of my blog that may sound weird- but it all comes down to the fact that my internship start got delayed until early August due to visa issues.

## Thoughts
Honestly, I don't feel extremely sad or extremely happy. If I had to choose, I'd say I'm happy; excited for what's in store. Throughout my life I've always been sad or afraid of 'the end,' whether that be the last day of highschool, the upcoming last day of my undergrad, or whatever other philosophical forthcoming. But I think this internship, and knowing that it's my last internship ever alongside my upcoming graduation, really made me mature and think: enjoy the moment, and don't worry about the future.

While of course having some sort of plan or thoughts about how to survive into the future is great, worrying about tiny things like what life will be like after graduation, how I'm going to be working for the next 50 or so years, or whatever else really just kills the mood of my present situation. I'm living in Japan, something that people would die for; I shouldn't spend my days worrying- they should be relaxed, and about searching for new experiences and appreciating the little things.

So yeah, on my last day of work I didn't feel particularly sad. I was excited for: the casual dinner with my coworkers, the nomikai and karaoke afterwards (haha) and of course that my friends were coming to Japan on December 26th (in 4 days!). Why would I kill my mood, and ruin the excitement I have for these future endeavours?

## What's happened since last time?
My cousin, her mom, and her friend all came to Tokyo, and I've been hanging out with them at every opportunity I could get. It's been really fun, mostly. I say mostly only because being a little translator isn't particularly up my alley. I do speak the language, and I can speak enough to survive, but I really don't enjoy speaking in a foreign language more than I need to; I'm not _that_ outgoing!

Anyways, I think the first day we met was a week ago yesterday and we walked around Harajuku. Not my kind of place, since it's too touristy, but no problem. Afterwards, we walked from Harajuku to Shibuya and ate some hot pot. Really good. All you can eat meat for 90 minutes, a side bar with salads, drink bar with matcha lattes?? and also dessert.

On Tuesday I ate at this sushi spot in Shibuya for the last time with the other intern. We splurged lol and tried some gold-flaked sushi. Good times. Gonna miss just eating food after work and strolling around Shibuya.

On Wednesday I went to Daiba to visit the Gundam base. I was quite disappointed. The stock was at least half of what they had when I visited in April 2023. Also, considering I had to come on a weekday, take a day off work, just to have the chance to ENTER the venue, was insane. Overtourism I suppose.

To clean up my sadness I just spent my time strolling around the mall and playing at the arcade. Playing MaiMai and taiko are things I will DEFINITELY miss out on. They lightened up my mood, especially considering that right before I lost 20-30 dollar on the crane machines... those darn things!

### Karaoke!??!
Sidenote- on Tuesday, since I had a lot of time I decided to go to Karaoke at around 9pm (Wednesday I was off work- so sleeping in was no problem). The staff asked for my student card and I told him I forgot it at home and that I was a university student in Canada. He said, no problem, we'll keep it a secret and I'll give you this student promotion. I couldn't read the kanji but I did understand it was a drinkbar.

Anyways I got my room receipt and was surprised to see my time ended at 5am- closing time. Wait.. had he given me free time? Free time meaning I can stay as long as I want until open. And hold up, I have unlimited soft drinks? I can order tea, pop, coffee, whenever?? AND DID HE SAY THE PRICE WAS 770YEN?

I WAS SOOO happy!!! This meant I could take my time searching for songs, translate the menu so that when my friends came I could teach them, and overall just relax between songs. And that I did. I even just stayed for half an hour watching Matthew play TFT lool. I'm definitely going back in a couple of days for this :)

Okay back to my main thoughts. Thursday I ate this amazing katsuya (called Maisen) with the other intern and of course it was great. We played Taiko and crane games afterwards and I met up with my cousin again to head to Don Quixote! I bought some things to give my family and the day ended normally.

I couldn't sleep that night for the life of me, and I think it's because I drank caffeine (matcha latte) with my cousin that day. So, I slept 6 hours and went into work at 9am for my last day of work. I was somehow able to lock in and finished one last task. Then, I created a fun graduation slideshow to present my coworkers. We also had lunch and dinner that day which were of course amazing. I actually left lunch early because I thought my exit interview was an hour earlier than scheduled- and I missed out on dessert. Whoops.

Saturday (yesterday) I hung out with my cousin again. We started in Akiba and I showed them my holy grail- TrioDX; k-pop official goods heaven. They went crazy! Love it~

We trekked to Shimbashi afterwards and had an amazing Wagyu kbbq. Our server was so cute and kind and even went out of the Japanese comfort zone and had small talk with us (in English; which to be fair her English was very good). Then for some reason every Karaoke near us wanted ID and one of us forgot out ID :(. So, we decided to go to Shinjuku for crane games. I couldn't find one I wanted to play so instead I played the hololive English ichiban kuji and I won... the top prize Gawr Gura visualboard. Crazy.

## What's next
Well, I have 3 days ish until my friends come, and I plan to do things that are better done while Japanese people work (i.e. when there's less people around). I'm going to go to a gaming cafe and play some counter strike and genshin. And I'm also going to go to Ikebukuro and hopefully check out all of k-books kpop without any troubles...

Lastly I need to move out of my apartment and pack (which I'm doing right after this!). Moving out will be just like the west, except that I need to attach garbage tags to my oversized garbage.

## Overall, rating?
What's my rating of my internship... hmm... I'll just do ratings with little elaboration (I'm feeling lazy)

Internship (Actual Work Experience, Career Growth): 8/10 - learned a lot of new tech

Japanese Lifestyle: 8/10 - super amazing. The missing two points are because of the things I miss from Canada- connections with friends, gaming, etc.

Hobbies: 100/10. Not much to say really. I'll miss Anime, K-pop and Trading Card shopping; a lot.

That's it really!

This will very likely be my last entry in this blog. I don't think I'll have the time to update it while vacationing with my friends, and quite frankly, I don't think those kinds of entries would be relevant to my internship experience that I've been writing about so far.

If you have somehow read all of my entries, I really do appreciate it.

Hopefully, one day when I grow up and mature even further I'll be able to look back on this blog and seriously appreciate the deep documentation I had of this experience. Until then, stay safe- future me!
