# We are so back
Back from Thailand, landed back November 16 in the evening. Lots to unwrap so let's just do it!

## Thailand Takeaways
Worth it, it hindsight. Okay I say in hindsight because I had a horrible case of diarrhea midway through the trip. By horrible, I really just mean I needed to go to the bathroom frequently to let out a barrage of liquid waste, NOT number 1. I thought I was going through the thick of it (haha...) but in hindsight it wasn't bad. Not sure what I ate that made me go crazy but it was chill, and in all honestly, a kind of detox??

Anyways. The main takeaway I have from going to Thailand is that Thai food is WAYYY better than Japanese food. Like seriously, Japanese food, if you really look at it, is just super simple, well-crafted food. I'm not a hater, it's edible and affordable. But you know what else is edible and affordable, oh and tastes incredible? Thai food.

Seriously. Take a step back after you purchase a regular meal in Japan. Maybe a beef bowl, ramen, bento box, whatever. Anything that isn't "luxury." What do you see? Often it's just some sort of carbs with meat. Where's the vegetables? Sauce? Take a bite. Do you often get an explosion of flavours that makes you think "man I'm going to miss this." - I only get this feeling when I eat luxury food, I'm talking like over $20 CAD for the meal. WHICH IS EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A WAGE IN YEN. LIFE HERE AS A REGULAR PERSON IS SO MUCH MORE DIFFERENT THAN AS A TOURIST. I don't know, I don't think I could eat like I am right now in Japan forever. I need fruits. I need to feel like what I'm eating is fulfilling calorie-wise and vitamin-wise.

Okay back to Thai food. I mean... come on, have you tried Thai street food? It's cheap. Like 2-3 dollars cheap. And better than most regular food I'll get in Japan. I had a feast everyday for breakfast, and it ran my whole family $7 a day. I had congee, sticky rice, fried meats, Thai desserts, soy milk. Like a literal feast as if it was my last supper. Then comes real meals. I mean I don't think I'd eaten that much food in one sitting since going to sushi, IN AUGUST. First night I was there I just chowed down on crab fried egg, fish, fried rice, stir fried vegetables, tom yum soup, and dessert. I felt like a king, and I want to feel like that daily.

Of course there was sooo much more Thai food but I can't go explaining everything. What I can explain is that Thailand, whether it be the city of Bangkok or a tourist town of Kapri or Pattaya, has exponentially more food options than Tokyo. Name a fast food chain. Thailand has it. American, Filipino, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, everything. There was a Maisen. That's one of the LUXURY food joints I have here in Japan. And it was in Bangkok. Oh yeah and affordable pizza! $10-15 mmmm, but there's more. The chefs there were trained by a retired Italian chef. That pizza was damn good, and it's a shame that pizza in the west is just fatty pieces of bread with dipping sauce, when in reality, real pizza actually tastes like a delicacy.

Alright what I'm realllly getting at is that Thailand has better tasting food overall, is about as affordable, has way more options, and actually allows you to affordably consume fruits, vegetables, and desserts. But then again, I was a tourist, not a person working there, so take that with a grain of salt- oh and many of the places I ate at were priced like it was a Canadian restaurant- they were damn expensive for a regular Thai person.

Finally, don't get me wrong. Tokyo and Japan are great places to live, but sometimes, it doesn't hurt to want _more_.

### Takeways, but not food
Too hot. Alas I think my body is moving from that of a child to an adult, finally? I mean, the heat just drains me. Both in August here in Tokyo, and last week in Bangkok. And that's fine, we're not built like machines. Knowing your limits and how to avoid poor situations is what learning is all about.

I complained about my 'health' (which again wasn't even that bad), and the heat, but it really was worth it for me to go to Thailand. Last time was 6 years ago and the next time, well who knows? If I'm flying from Canada to Asia, chances are I'll go to Japan, not Thailand. And seeing how much things have changed, for the city, and for the family members I reconnected with, really was an experience I'll probably not see for a while.

Lastly, I think my favourite touristy place was Pattaya. Bangkok is home. So much to do, but Pattaya feels like a place made for tourists. The selection of food was incredibly superb, and the nightlife really rounds off the place. I highly recommend visiting this seaside town if you want to go to Thailand- Bangkok is only 3 hours away by car!

## Now what?
Let's recount the days since I've landed from Thailand. On the first day (November 16, evening), I was able to skip the LOOONG visitor visa line and go straight to the 4 person re-entry permit line. From here to the skyliner (the high speed train taking me back to Tokyo from Narita), it was probably 15 minutes, lol. So damn quick, I love it!

Taking the Skyliner was chill, nothing much, and the walk back to my apartment was about the same. Ate Matsuya, rested, and slept late at like 2am and woke up late (at 10am... okay not late but it is what it is).

Spent the next day just resting at home and catching up on the 3 animes that I didn't watch while in Thailand (rezero, 2.5, and danmachi). ReZero is cooking btw please watch it!

Wasn't jetlagged or tired so I decided to go into the office on Monday (Nov 18), which was also chill. Just grinding away til our release. Tried pork belly at Matsuya which is amazing by the way... definitely try it. Some ice cream, then running to donki for some skin products that Thai security clearance took from me (angry face). Closed off my day by visiting Mandarake (nothing bought) and then also Tower Records. I was planning to buy NMIXX's ad mare album, but I saw aespa's armageddon album got restocked!! And then I realized STAYC's GPT Japanese version got released and I was like alright, I'll get aespa and NMIXX later (coping), and grab STAYC's album for the pre-order bonuses. Greatest idea ever. I won the gacha and got an extra photocard of Sieun, and an ISA photocard and sticker to add on top! Nice!

Day after (yesterday) I went to Akihabara and that's when I realized I am physically drained. Idk just felt tired and not really dizzy but pseudo-dizzy (vertigo-ish). Didn't feel like I was gonna knock out randomly and throw-up but it was just one of those, man my eyes are so damn tired my brain wants to turn off-kind of moments. Anyways I quickly grabbed another pokemon card for my crimson haze master set, and a couple of Moka photocards because trio dx restocked them :))) - finally some affordable Moka cards! Been waiting ;_;

As for today, just resting, needing my body to readjust to life here. It's sooo cold and when I landed mentally/physically it didn't click because I was expecting any weather colder than Thailand (about low 30s, celsius). Well, it's like 7-10 degrees celsius daily here, plus wind, which is a HUGE shock on my body. So rest it is. Also, if I keep stressing about not feeling good (when in reality I actually feel decent), then I'm just going to feel even worse mentally.

I'll probably do a quick bookoff run tomorrow to continue collecting all volumes of Chihayafuru. Oh yeah, I sent off my shipment of 37 manga volumes and my genshin cup. Honestly it was really easy to do. I bought the parcel box from the post office, and filled out all the logistics online (in English). Print a QR code after this to the post office, which prints the printing label (for free!) and then some logistical stuff like signing and things like that and your package is sent off (after paying of course).

My package weighed 5600 g, which is like 11-12 pounds for the imperial people. Shipping that costed 5500 yen ($50~ CAD). It seems expensive, and yes it is, but for the amount of weight I'm saving to haul back in my luggage, plus considering each Manga costed around 110 yen, it's actually pretty affordable. I'm talking like 200-300 yen for each volume of manga. You do the thinking there.

Anyways looking at all my stuff, and honestly as long as I don't go crazy on the figures (which I won't, I have no space), I should be more than able to fit everything in two luggages.

## The real closing remarks
In Thailand, I missed Tokyo. And in Tokyo, I miss my home in Canada. But coming back to Tokyo, I miss my time in Bangkok. Circular, funny! It's not healthy to think about what you've lost, but rather to think about what you gained and what you really enjoyed, which makes me really want to cherish the last 7 weeks-ish I have here in Tokyo. I don't want to force myself to go and do things for the sake of doing things, but just to be a little bit more pragmatic. My friends are coming in literally one month... which is going to be super fun. So for now, I'm going to enjoy the things in Tokyo that I like to do on my own, like spending long hours in card shops, and secondhand book stores.

_Once I leave Tokyo, graduate, and move on with life, the valuable memories, not matter how small, will last a lifetime; and I honestly couldn't complain one bit_
