# Thailand!
Been two weeks, time for an update! Nothing really in particular happened, but tomorrow I'm heading out to Thailand! Gotta wake up at 330am... so that I can shower, eat, and catch the first Skyliner to Narita Terminal 2. That'll get me there at around 626am, which should give me a decent amount of time to get to my gate by 830am.

## Purchases
Money. Okay I try to limit my spending but things happen :(. A summary of my purchases has been the new ILLIT album, aespa's new album, a bunch of pokemon cards to finish my Crimson Haze set, a subaru nendoroid (which I've been hunting FOR YEARSSSSSSS LETS GOOO + it was the cheapest I'd ever seen it)

## Worries?
It's not good to worry a lot about small things, as they'll often compound into a low-hanging stress that you don't take proper care of. So, for me I'm just going to vent out here. I guess my current worries are booking accommodations for when my friends come to Japan, and well making it to Thailand lol. Okay that's not supposed to be gruesome, rather than I just want to be there on time, and get my special re-entry permit so that I can return to Japan with no issues. I should know that it will all be fine honestly, but when I have as much time as myself right now, it really lets you get wild with your inner thoughts. All will be good in a couple of days :); plus, the accommodations really aren't that bad when you just realize that Tokyo is expensive.

### Yatta
Well I am super excited for Thailand! As I've previously stated I'm really just looking forward to munching down on Thai food, Thai desserts, and FRESH FRUITS!!! AHHHH lets goo!!! Probably going to limit my shopping a part from I guess some plushies! Nesoberis to be exact.

Anyways, take care y'all! Every day, something big or small gets better for you, so don't let the bad things swamp over the good things!
