# Holy Moly Guacamole!
Today's entry... is just because I have too much time today hehe. I'm trying to remember what I talked about last week lol. Already talked about the NMIXX pop up, but did I say... I went again!??!

## NM(II)XX
II because it's the second time. Ok so I went again like I said I would. I bought the drawstring bag which was tiny as heck! But whatever. I also bought the mini pouch because I really didn't want the buttons or pens. That brought my total to ~8000 yen which for myself I am content with. However, shoutout to the big boy Adam, for whom I bought a Lily keychain for and reached the 11000 yen threshold!! LUCKILY I won the polaroid (a copy of the signed one) and not a sticker, and now I am the proud owner of a gorgeous signed Lily polaroid! Super, duper worth it. Also for each 5500 you spend on goods, they give you a special photocard, and I got Bae and Lily. Sweet! Almost lucked out like a demon but the free sticker from the event (spend 5500, upload a picture to SNS, enjoy the fan zone) got me the same sticker I got from the first day... no complaints for a free item though, now a friend can have it :)

## Karaoke.
Alright I don't know what I've been doing with my life. After my first ever concert, IVE, I realized that man concerts are fun as hell if you go with friends/to artists that you enjoy enough. Well, I went to Karaoke last Friday for my first time ever and man... these Japanese party hard loooool.

Okay the context is we have a new parttimer (university student who is about to graduate), and one of our team members is doing an internal transfer to HR. We had samgyeopsal (I think I spelt that right) which is like a sort of tabletop KBBQ. Team dinners here are fun as always and it was nice eating a fat quantity of food and chatting with the mates. I drank 1 cocktail (as opposed to like 3 from my own welcoming party).

Afterwards we walked around and went to a nearby Karaoke place. So fun. What the heck!?!? I think alcohol makes things better (I had a gin tonic this time). Sang some Taylor Swift, crossing field, Idol (YOASOBI, which I failed at), and chimed along when others were whipping out some Japanese classics. There are wayyy too many songs which is why I really enjoyed it. I could sing a familiar English song, while jamming out to an Anime song I almost know by heart, and finishing with a Japanese song where I sight read the furigana. Also the new parttimer is a demon. Like in a good way. Bro CRANKED a hoshimachi suisei song and Idol when we attempted. Hell yeah.

You know what of the things I really appreciate here is that because people are so focused on themselves, they really don't care about you. As in, I can really be outgoing and forward with my hobbies; I don't need to be shy in singing an Anime song at Karaoke because it's so common here to just really like these kinds of things. In Canada, I wouldn't even dare to be heard in public singing an Anime song; like it's that idea of people thinking you're weird. But in Japan, being 'weird' is normal. Harajuku fashion here is commonspace, no one cares that you look like a character out of a dream, you're just a person. You can have an oshi bag filled with 100 of the same pin and people would literally not care. That's why I'm able to indulge in my hobbies so deeply here; it's just, well, accepted!

Obviously the idea of people not caring about you goes both ways, but let's just focus on the "you can be yourself and no one will bat an eye" aspect of it.

### Closing Remarks
Yeah not really much happened since last week. I bought a few more pokemon cards to continue finishing my crimson haze set but that's it. Also continuing to finish my chihayafuru collection, currently at, oh damn, like 13 volumes? There's like 50... I gotta pick up the pace otherwise January is gonna get here FAST.

Anyways, Thailand soon. Work is going well. Food is food (if it's edible that's enough for me). Dessert is YUM! Konbini food is so convenient when I'm hungry at 10pm. Also, FlyQuest did great!

Okay cyas~
