# We are so back
It's been 1 month (and a bit) since I've landed... holy cow. Like literally I can't believe it. Things have been great! Appetite is good, I'm adjusting well to life here and so on and so forth.

## Intern Welcoming Party (and more!)
Epic. We had like a 4-course (very small courses) sukiyaki which was great. Unlimited drinks, so I tried Japanese beer which was tame, and also a cola highball. Beer was nice, highball got to me lol. Food was alright to be honest but just hanging out with my coworkers was super fun. We even had a second round, where 4-5 of us when to an Irish pub and continued drinking. I had a gin tonic which was GREAT by the way. Also had a rum cola which is a classic, and then finished off the night with a "spicy" ginger ale. Like you know how normal ginger ale is just super sweet syrup? Well, imagine a true ginger taste, like that of a ginger syrup in tofu pudding, carbonized. It was STRONG I tell you but honestly pretty nice.

Chatting with my coworkers here was super fun haha. Just a lot of teasing, ladyboy mentions (two of us are Thai!), and overall relaxing.

Oh yeah, and the very next day the other intern (Harry) and I went to Golden Gai, a famous tourist spot with hundreds of small drinking bars stacked next to each other. Super fun, about $20 for 2 drinks and a cola and we just spent the night chatting (in English) to the bartender, a couple from SF, a couple of Vancouver, and the nicest and coolest German living in South Korea.

## Takeaways
I've been having lots of fun haha. I think there's a lot of soul searching going on, as in, learning about myself. I am introverted in the sense that I do enjoy my own time and doing things in my own pace a lot, but I don't think I could be by myself forever. The interactions I have with my coworkers and the other intern at my company are more than enough to suffice my needs.

Go at your own pace. I feel like living in a new country, you almost feel like you want to try something new everyday, like a new meal or searching a new place. While that is great, watch yourself! Physically, mentally, and also financially. Also, there's no need to force yourself to eat something new everyday. Some people, like me, only really eat food cause we have to lol. While I enjoy eating new, delicious food, if I eat like that everyday, well for one, I'd become mentally exhausting searching for new places, and two, I would have no money in my bank account... for my hobbies that I actually enjoy. Take it at your own pace.

Lastly, spending. I'm trying to spend less on food and more on my hobbies, but damn it is too easy to indulge here. Food is food, you need it to live so I'm okay with going the extra mile to buy a good meal. However, my hobbies, Anime and K-pop. People. It's too easy to spend on your hobbies here. I can go to the convenience store and buy a pokemon pack for 180 yen, or an IVE ichiban kuji for 730 yen. Not a lot, but everyday? Yeah it adds up. I'm trying to watch my spending so that I can both enjoy these smaller things like pokemon packs, while also spending large on a figure here and there. Just saying... this wouldn't have happened in Canada lol. I just don't have access like that, which is both a blessing and curse I guess, and also means that my large purchases are a figure once in a while; something that is easily manageable when you live rent-free.

## Some other stuff
Hobbies have been tooooo fun here! Here's a list of things I've bought:
- lfrith jiu (p-bandai wfm gundam for 4500 yen HOLY)
- kpop photocards (haewon., IVE pokemon set!, haewon polaroid)
- kpop albums (crazy [balaclava, kazuha, chaewon], after like, stick out)

OK GOODBYE TFT TIME
