# August 13
Oh baby, it's day after comiket day, and also my first day of work! Gonna keep this one short to rest up, since tomorrow I'm going to sign the lease for my apartment! No more Airbnb but that also means I need to buy furniture...

Okay comiket 104 (C104). Yo. Crazy. Like seriously. If you're a westerner and have never been to an Asian convention, let alone, comiket, believe me YOU ARE MISSING OUT. I don't think you could even reasonable trek through all of what there is to offer in a week. There's, what, like 12-14 different HALLS filled with corporate anime goodies, artist doujinshis, etc. I was there from open (11am) til 3:30pm and all I visited was 4 booths. Albeit I waited for a bit to get some stuff signed :) and to eat food! But man I would have been satisfied with just two of those booths. Life changing event for me and I really mean it.

First day of work. Fun! 42nd floor at Shibuya Scramble Square, met my fun coworkers, and chilled with some onboarding. After doing 4 co-ops previously, it gets mundane, but is necessary of course. Looking forward for the days to come.

Hoping my increased cardio helps to strengthen my body. I'm feeling much better until when I reallllllly exert myself. I'm not huffing and puffing for breath or anything, but I can feel that intense, heightened bloodrush that you usually get when you're doing the fattest leg press of your life. Okay exaggeration but you get me.

Good thing that happened today:
- Reliving comiket interactions!!
- Airpods are finally charging :pray: just took getting a new cable... Apple's iPhone cable they gave me doesn't work for it anymore :/
- Fun first day of work
- Social interactions

Nice stuff. We'll see when my next one is; perhaps the day of or after I move in?
