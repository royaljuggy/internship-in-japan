# Whoops... kinda forgot lol
Alright. August 22nd, and it's been 5 days since I moved in. Been living too nicely not gonna lie that I kinda forgot about this diary. Anyways, let's do some retrospectives!

## Move-in day
August 18th? It was chill. Took a taxi about 15 minutes from my Airbnb to my new place. About $30 but much better than the 1 hour commute by train with all my goodies. Funny story, the building next to mine is Harmony Terrace II and I live at Harmony Terrace I. They decided to use the same room numbers and I tried to go into someone else's apartment at Terrace II. Hopefully they weren't mad :(. A part from that, I had to walk 750m to the Japanese IKEA (Nitori) and buy a futon for about $60 CAD. Then I had to carry it from there, up a pedestrian bridge, back to my apartment. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GAINED THE POWER TO DO IT. Set that thing up quickly and ordered uber eats. Greatest KFC of my life.

That reminds me, maybe I should add some photos! I'm too lazy to put it into the markdown itself but a photos folder should be fine... right?

## Days after moving in
Okay it's kind of a blur now because my brain forgets stuff it doesn't like/doesn't care about. The gist of it is that I needed to buy: a desk, a chair, mugs, plates, water filter, hangers, etc. For the desk and chair, I bought a folding desk and chair from Nitori and carried those babies back in one dash. I still don't know how I did it because I promise you I am malnourished (food tastes better now don't worry).

Water filter I ordered from Amazon >:). Mugs, plates, hangers I bought at the dollar store which was great! Been to the grocery store right below the dollar store too and I'm realizing how expensive convenience stores are now... At the grocery store, a half loaf of Japanese sweet bread runs me 170 yen. CRAZY.

The walk to the station to get to work is horrible, since it's about 1km away. However, the street district there is amazing. So much culture, a large variety of restaurants, shops, and dessert places that makes it all worth it. Like imagine this: I need to get to Akihabara (one train line away from said station) but I'm also hungry. Okay, go to the Doutor next to the station before heading out!

Oh yeah Japanese people are bit odd. I'm realizing now how that they probably don't like foreigners, but due to their culture, it's something that they are not direct about, even to me a "Japanese"-passing person (visually). Living here versus being a tourist really changes your perspective.

Oh yeah (x2). Living here logistically is a PAIN. Why do I have to sign SOOO many papers just to open a bank account/get an apartment? Why do I have to buy a physical stamp instead of signing with a pen? Why do I have to go to the City Hall and register my address? Which by the way, they don't even check. You can literally put a random address in the ward and they would accept it. Fine by me I did it before I moved in anyways... Also garbage. I like the heightened frequency but why are there so many different garbage days? Paper, plastic, combustibles, plastic bottles, non-combustibles. I understand why lazy people here have piles of garbage in their homes. I really do understand.

The only good thing is that living alone in Waterloo has prepped me well for this.

## Yesterday's... torrential downpour
So I wanted to treat myself after moving in by going to Tower Records and visiting the K-pop store; buying whatever album I wanted. I bought IVE's After Like mini album (or whatever you call it) for 30% off... 1800 yen. WHAT A STEAL! Felt great, left the store and I see rain. Alright, rain ain't anything new and I need an umbrella anyways. Went to the convenience store, bought an umbrella and made my way to the station. Oh. It's a torrential downpour. Heavy rain? FLOOD WARNING? Alright... let's go on the train. Oh yeah they're paused. Huh I'm dumb. Let's leave the station and walk to an anime store and stay there til the rain dies down. Bad idea, but I didn't want to wait in that packed station anyways. The streets of Shibuya were FLOODED. Like I'm talking half a foot tall puddles of water everywhere. My shoes got soaked. Lower pants: DRENCHED. I got to the anime store but I was too wet to enter. Sat on the floor and wrung out my socks to keep them as dry as possible (I am so sorry Mr/Mrs/Ms. Janitor). Still soaked. Waited like 40 minutes for the rain to die down then went to Don Quixote and bought some sandals (which I needed anyways). Could have gotten a larger size but it's fine, they're gonna be for indoors anyways. Had to take a different path home, but it was fine. Left work at like 5pm and got home at 9pm.

Well, that's a lesson hard-learned. My shoes are mostly dry now and I hope they're okay tomorrow since I'm going into work...

Most of today's diary entry really was just me ranting, but that's because I didn't do much this week. This weekend, is going to be great. Saturday will be Diver City Mall (the gundam mall). Going to visit Gundam base, buy some clothes, check out Tower Records, and just have a good time. Sunday will be my Akihabara day. Going to walk around the city as much as I can then end the day by purchasing a figure. Hopefully I find something rare or cheap!

Til' next time, maybe next week? Who knows... we'll wait until another big event happens!
