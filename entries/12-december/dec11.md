# A Regular Update
Heyo~

Not much has happened since my last entry, but it's been long enough for an update. While it'd be nice for every update to have a new thing, sometimes normal, regular, mundane entries are more than enough.

## Solo Adventures
Last Friday was a chill one. I decided I wanted to relive my crane game winnings by heading out to Akabane for the night. I tried my hand again, but this time at Gigo... and well, it didn't go well. The crane wasn't really that strong and would its claw would often twirl, leaving me with attempts that were far off what I wanted.

Well, to move past a sad thing, you might want to try something happier. The night wasn't really a failure after all. Before hand I headed out to book off to try and complete my Chihayafuru collection, but unfortunately there were no more volumes for me to purchase. However, the book store is always a happy place and I will never complain about being able to look through their catalogue. What really made my night was firstly getting to try a McDonalds drink that I'd been dying for. It was like an ice frappe, strawberry flavour with whipped cream and strawberry bits. Worth it :).

Secondly, however, was solo karaoke! After hopping off the train near my apartment, I was walking home and remembered that the Karaoke box my coworkers and I went to in October had a location at my train station. I said, screw it, Karaoke was so fun last week ('Friday Night Lights'), and singing always uplifts me- let's run some solo karaoke!

I think what's great about living far from downtown Tokyo is that the people are super nice. The lady was helpful and more friendly than the Shibuya location, which made the atmosphere enjoyable. I decided to go with 30 minutes (to test soloing!) and a warm Oolong tea for the night. It costed me 1100 yen, and was well worth the fun; I was running out of English songs to sing at the end!

One thing I could have wished for was having my room on the higher floors. She assigned me a room on the floor, right in front of the reception desk. Not really a big deal for me, but when the rooms aren't truly soundproofed, being on the main floor isn't really the coolest. Plus, when the staff brought me my drink, I think the whole city could hear I was listening to Cruel Summer.

## A New Experience
I just remembered my fun Monday night experience! I decided to stay home this day, and so I went out of my comfort zone and headed to a highly rated traditional sushi place near my house. Expensive, I knew, but my time here is coming to an end, so why not enjoy it a bit.

A entered the place about 15 minutes after opening (5:45pm), and of course it was empty. This was exactly what I wanted. I took a seat by the counter and was provided the menu. The menu itself was a vertically-written, traditional menu with no pictures. Not a problem but I can't read Kanji, and I don't know the names of fishes in Japanese. So, I asked the staff to explain to me the menu (noting that I speak little Japanese) and both her and the sushi chef were kind enough to provide me a detailed, simple explanation of the menu. There were rolls (makis) on the left, and regular fish + sushi on the right (nigirizushi).

I ordered the 10 piece platter that they recommended. This platter had 3 makis and 7 nigirizushis. Taste-wise, definitely better than any chain I've had here, and good enough for me to say "you have to try the sushi in Japan!" What really made this meal delicious though, was the presentation. There were flowers spread across the plate, garnishes, and an arragement that created a simple eating flow. Left to right, or the opposite!

In addition to the meal, I had one of my favourite Japanese conversations here. Once the chef said "your Japanese is more than good enough," I believe they became comfortable enough to hold small talk and extended conversation with me. Three staff worked here that day and we exchanged chats about life in Japan, life in Canada, things we like, the taste of the food, what items in the restaurant were, and so much more. These sort of conversations with strangers was what I missed a lot in Canada, and I was so grateful to be able to hold some chats like that here in Tokyo, right by where I live.

To top off my night, I told them I'd never tried (Japanese) sake and that I would like to order some. They gave me a shot-glass size of a sake to have. Worth it. The sake was softly sweet (lightly) with not a strong alcohol taste. I couldn't tell the alcohol percent, but I knew for sure exactly why salarymen could drink this every night after work. Then it kicked in and I realized it was probably around the strength of soju lol. Japanese alcohol is DEADLY my friends!

To think it could not get better- it could. After about 90 minutes, I told the staff I was ready to leave (and purchase some dessert :) ). They told me the Sake was a service (on the house), and I told them my thanks! I really couldn't believe the hospitality I received, and I don't think I'll ever find the words to fully describe it~ The meal costed me about 2000 yen for just the 10 pieces of sushi, but it felt like I'd been given a priceless meal.

### Rambling
Okay I really rambled on today. Maybe last week wasn't as boring as I thought. Take care everyone :) til the next one!
